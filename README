To build and run immediately:
    $ make upload-run      # build quadcopter software, pc terminal, upload and run
    $ # or...
    $ JS=1 make upload-run # same as above but with joystick support

To build:
    $ make in4073 # build the quadcopter software
    $ make pc     # build the pc_terminal
    $ make sim    # build the simulator software (this one is a bit outdated and linux only)

To upload:
    $ make upload      # build and upload
    $ make upload-only # upload only
    $ make upload-run  # see above

To run:
    $ make pc-run  # run PC terminal with plotting enabled
    $ make sim-run # run simulator software
